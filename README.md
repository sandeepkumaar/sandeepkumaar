## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### About me
Full stack developer with Devops experience. Tech stack Reactjs, Nodejs, Expressjs, SQL, Mongodb, Streams.
I believe a leader should be **Trustworthy** and I make sure to create that trust among my peers.  
I like to code and manage/guide teams :)

### Tech stack/Items I've worked/familiar with
- Frontend: Reactjs, ReactRouter_v6, Native css,  vite|esbuild and nothing else.. :p. I like to keep the stack simple but efficient
- Backend: Nodejs, Express, Streams, Pino Logs, ErrorHandling, some good utils(object-validator, masking etc)
- DB: Mongodb, SQL
- Code setup:  ESM, Typescript through jsdocs, eslint, prettier, husky 
- Unix
- Apache pulsar, data ingestion process.
- Architecture diagrams using https://excalidraw.com/ 
- Comfortable and always prefer asynchronous programming
- Exposure on Security/Vulnerablity scans, fixes.

Checkout my pinned repositories and others. Star them if you like it. 

### Interested in
Devops, Blockchain and more OpenSource contributions

### My thought process
- I like simple, transparent, efficient tools than complex feature rich ones.
- JS ecoystem and web is growing fast, lot of changes over the years!! to keep myself upto date, my only rule -- #useThePlatform, choose frameworks/libs closer to the native platform.
